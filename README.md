# Word Embedding Models
## About
* Jupyter notebook completed in **Google Colab**
* Created 2 **Word2Vec Word Embedding Models**
   * One in **CBOW** format
   * One in **Skip Gram** format
   
 * Used **vector arithmetic** and gensim library to compare models with pretrained embedding models like **GloVe** and **Google**.
 * Utilized wefe module to test for **word embedding bias** in terms of racist text
 * Created a **BOW LR** and compared it with a **CBOW LR** using text embedding from the CBOW vectors found earlier
